<sub>Started stuyding: June 5th, 2022; Passed July 1st, 2022</sub>

First off, I recommend taking a look at the [overview page](https://cloud.google.com/training/cloud-infrastructure#cloud-engineer-learning-path) for the exam on Google's website if you haven't already. This will help you get a good understanding of what to expect on the exam.

Here is the [exam guide](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/cloud-engineer).
